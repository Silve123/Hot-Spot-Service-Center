            <h2>DATA BACKUP & RESTORE ADVISORY</h2>
            <p>Please note that Software Back up & Restore procedures are not covered under the manufacturer’s warranty terms and therefore this portion of the repair is billable. Should your device require a Software Reload or Main Board Replacement, there could be the possibility of data loss. If we are able to access the device’s memory, we will attempt to back up your data. All data including:Contacts, SMS, email messages, Photos, Music, Movies & Documents may be backed up and restored if accessible and are not corrupted. We however DO NOT Back Up and Restore any Non FactoryStandard Applications, Programs or Suites. These you will have to download and/or reinstall yourself.</p>

        <div className='contents'>
            <h2>Data Backup</h2>
            <p>Data Backup can only be completed should the device boot and is stable without rebooting itself. No installed applications/programs will be backed up. Although extreme care and all efforts will be taken in order not to lose any data, we cannot be held unconditionally responsible and/or liable if data is irretrievable, lost or corrupted during Back Up and Restore procedures. These procedures can take up to 3 – 5 hours, thus we recommend that you leave your device with us to allow enough time for the above to be undertaken in the proper manner. There is No Data Backup Charge should your data be irretrievable or if we are unable to perform the Back Up & Restore procedures. Should the Quote Not be accepted, we will still fulfil our warranty obligations and repair the device, but your data will be lost – this repair will then be performed at No Charge if the device is still within the Manufacturer’s Warranty period. You will be informed once your unit is ready for collection.</p>
